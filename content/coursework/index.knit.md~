## `Dara Guedem's Coursework Data`

To give a summary of some of the graduate courses that I have taken over the years, I created a data set of 29 courses and five variables where: 

  - year = academic year
  - season = Spring or Fall semester, 
  - FieldOfStudy = field of study, 
  - course = course department number and title, 
  - credits = the number of credits per course (1-10), and 
  - software = software used in a course. 
  
The table below summarizes some of the graduate level courses that I completed at the University of Montana during MA in Economics (2012 - 2015) and MSBA (2017 - 2018). I've also resourced myself through different books and online tutorials (from YouTube) post graduation. Lately, I have completed some online courses via Udemy.
