## `Dara Guedem's Coursework Data`

To give a summary of some of the graduate courses that I have taken over the years, I created a data set of 29 courses and five variables where: 

  - year = academic year
  - season = Spring or Fall semester, 
  - FieldOfStudy = field of study, 
  - course = course department number and title, 
  - credits = the number of credits per course (1-10), and 
  - software = software used in a course. 
  
The graph below shows some of the graduate level courses that I completed from the University of Montana; MA in Economics (2012 - 2015) and MSBA (2017 - 2018). I've also resourced myself through different books and online tutorials (from YouTube) post graduation. Lately, I have completed some online courses via Udemy.

Note: ECNS 599 is a 10 credits course split into 2 semesters (Fall 2014 and Spring 2015). 

## `Frequency of Software Usage`
Table of frequency of software used in the different courses that I completed over the years. 


```r
library(dplyr)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'dplyr'
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
## 
##     filter, lag
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
## 
##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
```

```r
freq_by_course <- coursework %>%
                    group_by(software) %>%
                    summarise(n = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
                    mutate(Frequency = paste0(round(100 * n/sum(n), 0), '%'))
freq_by_course
```

```
## # A tibble: 11 Ã— 3
##    software         n Frequency
##    <fct>        <int> <chr>    
##  1 "ArcGIS"         2 7%       
##  2 "docs"           3 10%      
##  3 "docs & PPT"     2 7%       
##  4 "Excel"          1 3%       
##  5 "PostgreSQL"     1 3%       
##  6 "Power BI"       1 3%       
##  7 "Python "        3 10%      
##  8 "R"              8 28%      
##  9 "SPSS"           1 3%       
## 10 "Stata"          6 21%      
## 11 "Weka"           1 3%
```

Note: I've used STATA the longest because I started using it as an undergraduate student at the UM.
