Over the past ten-plus years, I have been studying economics, mathematics, data analytics, and data visualization, and have earned both an MA in Economics (2015) and an MS in Data Analytics (2018) from the University of Montana (UM). I arrived in Missoula, Montana, in 2007 as an international student to continue my education in Economics and to join family members who live here. Prior to that, I started studying Economics abroad, at Cheikh Anta Diop University (UCAD), in Dakar, Senegal. I successfully transferred some of my classes from UCAD to UM in the Fall of 2008, after a year of intensive English learning at the English Language Institute (ELI). Fast forward to 2013, while in graduate school, I met my boyfriend then and now husband since August 2020. In October 2021, I received my authorization to legally work in the USA so that I can now pursue my professional interests.
 
My goal is to work in data/business analytics, bringing my background in regression analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, as well as my interest in developmental, health, and hedonic economics. I also have a deep appreciation of mathematics and statistics as they are essential to perform analyses of social and economic events via data and draw empirical conclusions, and for history because we can both learn from our past and better predict the future through the nuanced use of historical data.
 
As an undergraduate and graduate student, I worked in various positions and internships, including as a project intern at Data Smart Solutions (using Microsoft products, SQL, and R); as a data administrator at NewNet Services (using AutoCAD and SQL); and, more recently, as a Data Analyst - Intern at Akros (using Stata17). During this internship, some of my work consisted of cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, and standardizing large datasets of more than 300,000 observations. To increase my technical skills and explore my own personal interests, I recently learned Microsoft Power BI tools for data visualization. I also created this portfolio website through the Blogdown package in the R-statistical package. One of my most recent projects involves analyzing datasets downloaded from Kaggle of two decades of Craigslist posts for housing rentals in the San Francisco Bay area (for more information, see the Projects section of my portfolio). 

My past work in analyzing data has consisted of both theoretical and empirical research. In this section, I am going to briefly describe three of many projects that I worked on while completing my graduate program in Data Analytics. For instance, for my “Text Mining of Unstructured Data (BMIS 694) course, I scraped data from Twitter to compare two groups of users based on who they follow: for example, a democrat versus a republican. After spending some time exploring the data, I realized that most of the accounts were not real but bots. This discovery changed the course of my class’s project and led me to study ways to detect bots and flag them, so that fake posts could be reduced. When it comes to data analysis, having credible data is crucial; otherwise, it’s “garbage in and garbage out” as they say. Another project, my capstone, consisted of dealing with selection bias and offering a solution to data design and collection to Missoula in Motion. Finally, a fascinating hands-on business analytics was during my internship (MBA 698) in the Autumn semester of 2017 with Spark! Arts, a non-profit organization introduced in Missoula in 2013, whose mission is to make sure creative arts are accessible to all Missoula County Public Schools (MCPS). Some of my involvements were helping with their data management (in excel); assessing the primary marketing challenge that it was facing; and creating a PowerPoint presentation of the teaching artist residency evaluation forms that compared the progress of the program one year later (2014) to 2017 for the director at the time to present at a conference to the program’s sponsor, the Kennedy Center’s Any Given Child Initiative. Today, the program keeps on growing strongly and making differences in art teachers’ lives and children’s schooling since arts unlock great potential in humankind.
 
For my MA thesis in Economics, I analyzed the relationship between the South African Child Support Grant (CSG) on children’s nutritional status, using data from the National Income Dynamic Survey (NIDS). This grant is given to parents, depending on their income levels, to care for their children. First, I used a logistic regression model to analyze characteristics that qualify caregivers to receive a CSG. Second, I used an adjusted regression model to analyze the weight for age z-score (WAZ: short-term indicator) and height for age z-score (HAZ: long-term indicator) of the children whose caregivers received the grant to assess the impact of the CSG on those indicators. More about this and other research/projects can be found under the projects tab of my portfolio. 
 
Learning languages is of great interest to me. In addition to my native language, Laga, I’m fluent in English and French, spoke Arabic a bit while growing up in my native country and am currently also learning Spanish. I enjoy reading; outdoor activities in Montana, including gardening in the summer, and cross-country and downhill skiing in the winter with my husband. Since relocating to Missoula, I’ve also been passionate about volunteering within my community. While attending the University of Montana, I was actively involved with Griz for UNICEF, fundraising for clean water for children in developing countries. I also helped cook for Missoula’s homeless shelter and took care of the elderly at the Spring Retirement Center. Everyone needs help from time to time and showing them that you care is very healing for all of us. 
 
Through all these various experiences, I am constantly growing personally and professionally. If hired, I believe I will be a great addition, bringing a rich and diverse background to the workplace.
