In this Na√Øve Bayes Classifier analysis, I used two sets of data I pulled from Twitter API in November 2017. The tweets were from the Africa Science and the Society for Science magazines Twitter accounts. Both magazines mostly cover science, health, and environmental 
topics from various places. Africa Science is created in Kenya while the Society for Science is 
headquartered in Washington DC. The findings are not conclusive; however, they are very informative about
words patterns that are particular to one magazine than the other. Moreover, the frequency and context of word usages can be helpful to know the nature of Twitter subscribers, that they are real account or bots, an important characteristic to rule out when analyzing tweets.
