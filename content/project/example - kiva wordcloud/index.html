In this exploratory analysis, I explored two sets of data sets pull from Twitter for the Africa Science and 
the Society for Science magazines. Both magazines mostly cover science, health, and environmental 
topics but from various places. Africa Science is created Kenya while the Society for Science is 
headquarters in Washington DC. The findings are not conclusive; however, they are informative of 
words patterns that are particular to one magazine than the other. Lexicon plots show words that are 
very prominent in one magazine than in the other.
