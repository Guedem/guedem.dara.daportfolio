Diabetes is a debilitating condition affecting millions of people worldwide. The International Diabetes Federation definition of "diabetes prevalence refers to the percentage of people ages 20-79 who have  type 1 or type 2 diabetes. It is calculated by adjusting to a standard population age-structure." (see source). According to the World Health Organization November 2021 report, the number of people with diabetes cases has been increasing worldwide since 1980, especially in low and middle income countries. The prevalence of diabetes is rapidly increasing. Based on the International Diabetes Federation 2021 findings: "537 million adults (20 - 79 years) are living with diabetes - 1 in 10. This number is predicted to rise to 643 million by 2030 and 783 million by 2045." 

The objective of this project in Tableau is to visualize the trends of diabetes prevalence (% of population ages 20 - 79) over time and by income groups.
